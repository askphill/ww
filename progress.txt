## Iterations

### Iteration: 2026-01-13
**Story:** US-001 - Create AnnouncementBar component
**Status:** Complete

**What was done:**
- Created AnnouncementBar.tsx component matching header styling patterns
- Used same padding (px-4 mobile, md:px-6 desktop), max-width (600px), and rounded-card
- Applied bg-ocher background with text-black font-display text-small styling
- Component accepts a `message` prop for customizable announcement text
- Verified build passes (typecheck has pre-existing errors unrelated to this component)

**Files changed:**
- apps/website/app/components/AnnouncementBar.tsx (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Header uses `pointer-events-none` on wrapper and `pointer-events-auto` on inner content for floating behavior
- Theme has `@keyframes marquee` and `animate-marquee` utility already defined for US-002
- Pre-existing typecheck errors exist in packages/ui and packages/hooks (React types) - build still works

### Iteration: 2026-01-13 (continued)
**Story:** US-002 - Add marquee animation to AnnouncementBar
**Status:** Complete

**What was done:**
- Added continuous scrolling animation using existing `animate-marquee` utility
- Duplicated message text to create seamless looping effect
- Applied `overflow-hidden` to container to clip the scrolling content
- Changed from `text-center` to `flex whitespace-nowrap` for proper marquee layout
- Each message has `px-8` spacing for visual separation in the loop

**Files changed:**
- apps/website/app/components/AnnouncementBar.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Marquee animation works by translating -50% so duplicating content creates seamless loop
- `whitespace-nowrap` is essential to prevent text wrapping in marquee
- Build passes but typecheck has pre-existing errors (unrelated to this work)
