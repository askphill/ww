## Iterations

### Iteration: 2026-01-13
**Story:** US-001 - Create AddedToBagPopup component structure
**Status:** Complete

**What was done:**
- Created AddedToBagPopup component at apps/website/app/components/AddedToBagPopup.tsx
- Defined AddedToBagPopupProduct interface with image, title, variantTitle, price, currencyCode
- Defined AddedToBagPopupProps interface with isOpen, onClose, product, cartCount, checkoutUrl
- Component returns null when isOpen is false or product is null
- Basic placeholder UI structure added

**Files changed:**
- apps/website/app/components/AddedToBagPopup.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Pre-existing typecheck errors exist in @wakey/seo-engine and other packages (not related to website)
- Use `pnpm build --filter=@wakey/website` to verify just the website package builds successfully
- The Aside.tsx component is a good pattern reference for slide-in/out drawer components
- StickyAddToCart.tsx shows how to integrate with CartForm and useAside

### Iteration: 2026-01-13
**Story:** US-002 - Style AddedToBagPopup to match design system
**Status:** Complete

**What was done:**
- Applied bg-black text-sand color scheme for dark theme matching On Running style
- Used rounded-card utility for consistent border radius
- Applied type scale utilities: text-s2 for title, text-paragraph for product name, text-small for variant
- Added close button with CrossIcon from @wakey/ui positioned top-right using flexbox justify-between
- Added hover:opacity-70 transition for close button interactivity

**Files changed:**
- apps/website/app/components/AddedToBagPopup.tsx (updated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- CrossIcon is exported from @wakey/ui via packages/ui/src/icons/index.ts
- Design system colors are in packages/tailwind-config/theme.css (--color-sand, --color-black, etc.)
- Type scale utilities (text-s2, text-paragraph, etc.) are defined in theme.css as @utility rules
- The rounded-card utility provides responsive border radius (0.3125rem mobile, 0.625rem desktop)
