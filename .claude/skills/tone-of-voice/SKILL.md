# Tone of Voice Skill

Write copy that follows the Wakey brand voice guidelines. Use this skill for any copywriting task.

## Invocation

```
/tone-of-voice [copy request]
```

Examples:

```
/tone-of-voice Write a product description for our new face wash
/tone-of-voice Draft an email announcing our summer sale
/tone-of-voice Create social media captions for deodorant launch
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the Guidelines

**Always read the tone of voice document first:**

```
brand/tone-of-voice.md
```

This document is the source of truth and may be updated. Never rely on cached knowledge of the guidelines.

### Step 2: Understand the Context

Identify the context for the copy:

| Context                | Tone                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Product description    | Cheeky, sensory, anchored by one fact |
| Social media           | Playful, observational, warm          |
| Email marketing        | Friendly, direct, a little flirty     |
| Shipping/transactional | Straight to the point                 |
| Ingredient info        | Clear, minimal, factual               |
| Customer complaints    | Warm first, light if appropriate      |
| Serious issues         | Warm, direct, no jokes                |

### Step 3: Apply the Voice Attributes

Check that your copy follows these principles:

1. **Cheeky, not childish** - Wink and tease, but don't try too hard
2. **Warm, not soft** - Care without coddling, say it in few words
3. **Real, not raw** - Embrace mess without being cynical
4. **Confident, not preachy** - Know what you stand for without lecturing
5. **Positive, not naive** - Look for the light without toxic positivity
6. **Specific, not vague** - Point to things you can picture, count, or verify

### Step 4: Run the Checks

Before delivering copy, verify:

**The Wakey Test:**

1. Would I actually say this to a friend?
2. Can someone picture what I'm describing?
3. Is every word earning its place?
4. Does it sound like a person?
5. Is it true? Could I prove it?

**The Falsifiability Test:**

Could a bad product also say this? If yes, rewrite.

| Fails the test | Passes the test                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Good stuff"   | "Coconut oil from Sri Lanka"          |
| "High quality" | "No parabens, sulfates, or silicones" |
| "Long lasting" | "Still working at midnight"           |

### Step 5: Deliver Options

Provide 2-3 copy options when possible. Explain which guidelines each option emphasizes.

## Key Rules

### Always Use

- "We" and "you" - direct, never generic
- Short sentences - if it can lose three words, it should
- Specific facts - ingredients, origins, durations, prices
- Sensory language anchored by one concrete detail
- Humor from shared morning experiences

### Never Use

- Emojis (unless user explicitly requests)
- Exclamation marks (rare exceptions)
- Buzzwords: "seamless", "solution", "elevated", "curated", "transform", "revolutionary"
- Vague claims: "good", "quality", "premium", "best", "better for you"
- Guilt or fear tactics
- Anything you can't picture, count, or verify

### Words We Love

| Use these | Instead of these           |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Morning   | Routine                    |
| Skin      | Dermal / Epidermis         |
| Fresh     | Rejuvenated                |
| Works     | Delivers results           |
| Simple    | Streamlined                |
| Real      | Authentic                  |
| You       | Customers / Users          |
| We        | The brand / Wakey believes |
| Ritual    | Routine / Regimen          |

Slang is welcome: vibe, lowkey, kind of obsessed, into it, not gonna lie
