Hey future mom or mom-to-be! Being pregnant is a beautiful time, but let's be honest, some of those changes are less glamorous. Like increased sweating, which for some women can lead to uncomfortable odours. That's why it's crucial to find a safe deodorant without harmful ingredients for pregnancy or when trying to conceive.

But don't worry, there are good natural alternatives that are safe for you and the baby. Here are a few key things to look for when choosing a natural deodorant.

## No Aluminium

Many conventional deodorants contain aluminium, a metal that blocks sweat. Unfortunately, there is still debate about the safety of aluminium and its possible link to breast cancer. It's better to play it safe and avoid deodorants that contain aluminium.

## No Chemicals

Parabens, phthalates, and other chemicals can have hormone-disrupting effects and are therefore better avoided during pregnancy.

## No Baking Soda

Yes, baking soda can be a great absorbing ingredient in natural deodorants, but for some pregnant women, it can cause irritation. So look for a baking soda-free formula.

## No Fragrance

Believe it or not, but fragrance can be a mix of dozens of synthetic chemicals that can cause irritation and allergic reactions. Go for a deodorant with a natural scent, like essential oils.
