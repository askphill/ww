Some mornings are calm. Others are a bit of a mess. Alarms get snoozed. Coffee spills. But lately, I've come to appreciate those first few minutes, not for being perfect, but for being ours.

Becoming a mom changed the way I think about mornings. They're not just about getting ready. They're about connecting. Sitting down for breakfast together. Stepping outside to feel the morning sun. Taking a beat before the day really begins.

At **Wakey**, we believe those first five minutes matter. Not because you need a 10 step routine, but because they're a chance to check in with yourself, your skin, your people.

We make feel-good essentials for real mornings. Simple routines that wake up your skin and your mood.

Honest ingredients. Thoughtful formulas. Joy-forward care that helps you feel fresh, grounded, and ready for whatever's next.

Because small rituals can shift your whole day. And mornings are the perfect place to begin.

Wakey. Wakey. Mornings, made better.

</Founder>
