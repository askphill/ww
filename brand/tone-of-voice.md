## WAKEY TONE OF VOICE GUIDELINES

### WHO WE ARE IN ONE LINE
The friend who texts you something funny while you're still half asleep, then reminds you that you've got this.

---

### BRAND VOICE ATTRIBUTES

**1. Cheeky, not childish**
We wink, we tease, we keep it light. But we're not trying too hard. The humor lands because it's true, not because we're performing.

**2. Warm, not soft**
We care about you. We're rooting for you. But we're not going to coddle you with fluffy language. We say what we mean in as few words as possible.

**3. Real, not raw**
We embrace the mess of mornings. Pillow creases, snooze buttons, that first look in the mirror. But we're not cynical or gross about it. We find the beauty in the ordinary.

**4. Confident, not preachy**
We know what we stand for. We don't need to lecture you about sustainability or guilt you into better choices. We just do the right thing and invite you along.

### HOW WE SPEAK

**We say "we" and "you"**
Always direct. Never generic. We're talking to one person having one morning.

*Yes:* "We made this for the mornings you'd rather skip."
*No:* "Wakey believes in helping customers start their day right."

**We keep it short**
If a sentence can lose three words, it should. The reader gets it instantly or we've failed.

*Yes:* "Smells like you slept eight hours. Even if you didn't."
*No:* "Our carefully crafted fragrance is designed to help you feel refreshed and energized, giving you the sensation of a full night's rest."

**We get specific**
No vague promises. We describe what you'll actually experience. How it feels on your skin. What it smells like. What your morning becomes.

*Yes:* "A citrus hit that cuts through the fog. Leaves your skin cool, not tight."
*No:* "A refreshing formula that provides an invigorating experience."

**We find the funny in the familiar**
Our humor comes from shared experience. The snooze button. The toothpaste on your shirt. The coffee that's never ready fast enough.

*Yes:* "For faces that need a minute."
*No:* "Wake up and seize the day with our energizing formula."

| Shipping notifications | Straight to the point | "Your order shipped. Arriving Thursday." |
| Ingredient info | Clear, minimal, no fluff | "Coconut oil. Softens. Smells like you think it does." |
| Customer complaints | Warm first, light if appropriate | "That's not the morning we wanted for you. Let's fix it." |
| Serious issues | Warm, direct, no jokes | "We hear you. Here's what we're doing about it." |

### THE WAKEY TEST

Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. Would I actually say this to a friend at 7am?
2. Can someone picture what I'm describing?
3. Can I cut any words without losing meaning?
4. Does it sound like a person or a brand?
5. Is it true?

If any answer is no, rewrite.

### EXAMPLE REWRITES

**Generic:** "Our deodorant provides long-lasting freshness and is made with natural ingredients for a better morning routine."

**Wakey:** "Don't sweat it. 48 hours of not thinking about it."

---

**Generic:** "We believe everyone deserves access to high-quality personal care products that are sustainable and effective."

**Wakey:** "Good stuff. Fair price. No weird ingredients you can't pronounce."

---

**Generic:** "Start your morning right with our energizing body wash that will leave you feeling refreshed and ready for the day."

**Wakey:** "Smells like grapefruit. Feels like cold water on your face. You're up now."

---

### ONE LAST THING

Wakey isn't here to fix mornings. Mornings don't need fixing. We're here to make them a little better, a little kinder to your skin, a little more yours.

That's it. That's the vibe.
