## WAKEY TONE OF VOICE GUIDELINES

---

### WHO WE ARE IN ONE LINE

The one who actually likes mornings and makes you think maybe you could too.

---

### WHAT WE BELIEVE

Mornings get a bad reputation. They're rushed, they're chaotic, they're something to get through. But we see it differently.

Every morning is a fresh start. You get a new one every day. Might as well like it.

We're not here to sell you a 10-step routine or a perfect sunrise moment. We're here for the real version. The calm ones. The messy ones. The alarms that get snoozed. The coffee that spills. The kids jumping on the bed.

We believe the first five minutes matter. Not because they need to be optimized, but because they're yours. A small ritual. A moment to check in with yourself, your skin, your people, before the day really begins.

In a world full of sameness and negativity, we choose to highlight the beauty of mornings. Small rituals can shift your whole day. And mornings are the perfect place to begin.

### BRAND VOICE ATTRIBUTES

**1. Cheeky, not childish**
We wink, we tease, we keep it light. But we're not trying too hard. The humor lands because it's true, not because we're performing.

**2. Warm, not soft**
We care about you. We're rooting for you. But we're not going to coddle you with fluffy language. We say what we mean in as few words as possible.

**3. Real, not raw**
We embrace the mess of mornings. Pillow creases, snooze buttons, that first look in the mirror. But we're not cynical or gross about it. We find the beauty in the ordinary.

**4. Confident, not preachy**
We know what we stand for. We don't need to lecture you about sustainability or guilt you into better choices. We just do the right thing and invite you along.

**5. Positive, not naive**
We know mornings aren't always easy. But we choose to see what's good in them. Not toxic positivity. Just a lens that looks for the light.

**6. Specific, not vague**
We point to things you can picture, count, or verify. If we can't prove it, we don't say it.

### THE WAKEY CONTRAST

We don't have enemies. But we do have a point of view.

| Wakey is for | Not for |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Real mornings | Performed mornings |
| The 7am version of you | The Instagram version |
| Small rituals | 10-step routines |
| Appreciating the chaos | Just getting through it |
| Fresh starts | Autopilot |

We're not against anything. We just choose to notice what others scroll past.

---

### HOW WE SPEAK

**We say "we" and "you"**
Always direct. Never generic. We're talking to one person having one morning.

_Yes:_ "We made this for the mornings you'd rather skip."
_No:_ "Wakey believes in helping customers start their day right."

**We keep it short**
If a sentence can lose three words, it should. The reader gets it instantly or we've failed.

_Yes:_ "Smells like you slept eight hours. Even if you didn't."
_No:_ "Our carefully crafted fragrance is designed to help you feel refreshed and energized, giving you the sensation of a full night's rest."

**We point, we don't claim**
No vague promises. We describe what you'll actually experience or we state a fact you can verify. "Good" is not a fact. "Sourced from coconuts" is.

_Yes:_ "Coconut oil from Sri Lanka. Sinks in before your coffee's ready."
_No:_ "High quality ingredients for a premium experience."

_Yes:_ "48 hours of not thinking about it."
_No:_ "Long lasting protection."

_Yes:_ "A citrus hit that cuts through the fog. Leaves your skin cool, not tight."
_No:_ "A refreshing formula that provides an invigorating experience."

**We anchor feeling with fact**
Sensory first, then one concrete detail if it earns its place. The fact should make the feeling believable, not turn it into a lab report.

_Yes:_ "Sinks in fast. Still there at 6pm."
_No:_ "Absorbs in approximately 3.2 seconds with a 12 hour moisture retention rate."

**We find the funny in the familiar**
Our humor comes from shared experience. The snooze button. The toothpaste on your shirt. The coffee that's never ready fast enough.

_Yes:_ "For faces that need a minute."
_No:_ "Wake up and seize the day with our energizing formula."

**We use dashes sparingly**
Dashes can create rhythm and land a punchline. Use them when you need a beat, a pause before the payoff. Not as default punctuation.

_Yes:_ "You're not you when you're hungry." becomes "You're not you - when you're hungry."
_Yes:_ "We know life is short - and mornings are shorter - but moments are as long as you make them."
_No:_ Using dashes in every other sentence.

### WORDS WE LOVE

| Use these | Instead of these           |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Morning   | Routine                    |
| Skin      | Dermal / Epidermis         |
| Fresh     | Rejuvenated                |

**Slang is welcome:** vibe, lowkey, kind of obsessed, into it, not gonna lie

**Facts are welcome:** specific ingredients, where things come from, how long something lasts, what it costs, what's not in it

---

### WORDS AND THINGS WE NEVER USE

- Emojis
- Exclamation marks (very rare exceptions)
- "Seamless" / "Solution" / "Elevated" / "Curated"
- "Clean beauty" (we just are, we don't need to say it)
- "Sustainable" as a selling point (it's a given, not a headline)
- "Transform" / "Revolutionary" / "Game-changer"
- "Good" / "Quality" / "Premium" / "Best" (prove it or lose it)
- "Better for you" (compared to what?)
- Generic claims that a competitor could also say
- Guilt or fear tactics about other products
- Crude language (no "crap," "bullshit," etc.)
- Anything you can't picture, count, or verify

---

### THE FALSIFIABILITY TEST

Before you write a claim, ask: could a bad product also say this?

| Fails the test        | Passes the test                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "Good stuff"          | "Coconut oil from Sri Lanka"                       |
| "High quality"        | "No parabens, sulfates, or silicones"              |
| "Fair price"          | "Costs less than your morning coffee"              |
| "Long lasting"        | "Still working at midnight"                        |
| "Natural ingredients" | "Five ingredients. You can pronounce all of them." |
| "Effective formula"   | "Clears oil without that tight feeling"            |

If a competitor selling garbage could make the same claim, rewrite it.

### TONE BY CONTEXT

| Context                | Tone                                  | Example                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product description    | Cheeky, sensory, anchored by one fact | "Thick enough you'll feel it. Light enough you'll forget it. Shea butter from Ghana." |
| Social media           | Playful, observational, warm          | "Show us your morning face. The real one."                                            |
| Email marketing        | Friendly, direct, a little flirty     | "We made something. Smells like grapefruit. Sinks in fast. You'll probably want it."  |
| Shipping notifications | Straight to the point                 | "Your order shipped. Arriving Thursday."                                              |
| Ingredient info        | Clear, minimal, factual               | "Coconut oil. Softens skin. From Sri Lanka."                                          |
| Customer complaints    | Warm first, light if appropriate      | "That's not the morning we wanted for you. Let's fix it."                             |
| Serious issues         | Warm, direct, no jokes                | "We hear you. Here's what we're doing about it."                                      |

### WAKEY LINES

These phrases capture who we are. Use them as reference points, in campaigns, or as inspiration.

**The tagline:**
Making the world a better place, one morning at a time.

**The slogans:**
- Show us your morning face.
- Join the good morning movement.
- Everyone's a morning person. (Some mornings just start at 11:00 AM.)
- Live a little. Or a lot.
- Each morning is a new beginning. Celebrate new beginnings with new habits.
- You get a new one every day. Might as well like it.
- Rise & Shine.
- Happiness is power.

**Movement moments:**
Use these where it feels natural - email sign-offs, post-purchase, social CTAs, packaging. Make people feel like insiders without asking them to "join" anything explicitly. Less recruitment energy, more "you get it, we get it."

- "Welcome to the club"
- "You're in"
- Time-based greetings: "Hi, Early bird!" / "Hey, Fresh face." / "You: Stop scrolling!"

---

### THE WAKEY TEST

Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. Would I actually say this to a friend at 7am?
2. Can someone picture what I'm describing?
3. Can I cut any words without losing meaning?
4. Does it sound like a person or a brand?
5. Is it true? Could I prove it?
6. Could a bad product make the same claim?

If any answer is wrong, rewrite.

---

### ONE LAST THING

Every morning is a fresh start. Some are calm. Some are chaos. All of them count.

We're not here to optimize your morning. We're here to help you notice it.

Small rituals. Real moments. The first five minutes that set up everything else.

Making the world a better place, one morning at a time.
