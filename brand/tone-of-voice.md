## WAKEY TONE OF VOICE GUIDELINES

---

### WHO WE ARE IN ONE LINE

The friend who texts you something funny while you're still half asleep, then reminds you that you've got this.

---

### THE ENEMY WE'RE AGAINST

We're not against other brands. We're not against mornings. We're against the performance.

The toothpaste smile. The perfectly lit bathroom. The "I woke up like this" that nobody believes. The idea that your morning needs to look a certain way to count.

Wakey is for the 7am version of you, not the Instagram version.

This tension runs through everything we say. We choose real over polished. Pillow creases over ring lights. The face you actually have over the one you're supposed to show.

---

### BRAND VOICE ATTRIBUTES

**1. Cheeky, not childish**
We wink, we tease, we keep it light. But we're not trying too hard. The humor lands because it's true, not because we're performing.

**2. Warm, not soft**
We care about you. We're rooting for you. But we're not going to coddle you with fluffy language. We say what we mean in as few words as possible.

**3. Real, not raw**
We embrace the mess of mornings. Pillow creases, snooze buttons, that first look in the mirror. But we're not cynical or gross about it. We find the beauty in the ordinary.

**4. Confident, not preachy**
We know what we stand for. We don't need to lecture you about sustainability or guilt you into better choices. We just do the right thing and invite you along.

**5. Specific, not vague**
We point to things you can picture, count, or verify. If we can't prove it, we don't say it.

---

### HOW WE SPEAK

**We say "we" and "you"**
Always direct. Never generic. We're talking to one person having one morning.

_Yes:_ "We made this for the mornings you'd rather skip."
_No:_ "Wakey believes in helping customers start their day right."

**We keep it short**
If a sentence can lose three words, it should. The reader gets it instantly or we've failed.

_Yes:_ "Smells like you slept eight hours. Even if you didn't."
_No:_ "Our carefully crafted fragrance is designed to help you feel refreshed and energized, giving you the sensation of a full night's rest."

**We point, we don't claim**
No vague promises. We describe what you'll actually experience or we state a fact you can verify. "Good" is not a fact. "Sourced from coconuts" is.

_Yes:_ "Coconut oil from Sri Lanka. Sinks in before your coffee's ready."
_No:_ "High quality ingredients for a premium experience."

_Yes:_ "48 hours of not thinking about it."
_No:_ "Long lasting protection."

_Yes:_ "A citrus hit that cuts through the fog. Leaves your skin cool, not tight."
_No:_ "A refreshing formula that provides an invigorating experience."

**We anchor feeling with fact**
Sensory first, then one concrete detail if it earns its place. The fact should make the feeling believable, not turn it into a lab report.

_Yes:_ "Sinks in fast. Still there at 6pm."
_No:_ "Absorbs in approximately 3.2 seconds with a 12 hour moisture retention rate."

**We find the funny in the familiar**
Our humor comes from shared experience. The snooze button. The toothpaste on your shirt. The coffee that's never ready fast enough.

_Yes:_ "For faces that need a minute."
_No:_ "Wake up and seize the day with our energizing formula."

### WORDS WE LOVE

| Use these | Instead of these           |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Morning   | Routine                    |
| Skin      | Dermal / Epidermis         |
| Fresh     | Rejuvenated                |

**Slang is welcome:** vibe, lowkey, kind of obsessed, into it, not gonna lie

**Facts are welcome:** specific ingredients, where things come from, how long something lasts, what it costs, what's not in it

---

### WORDS AND THINGS WE NEVER USE

- Dashes of any kind
- Emojis
- Exclamation marks
- "Seamless" / "Solution" / "Elevated" / "Curated"
- "Clean beauty" (we just are, we don't need to say it)
- "Sustainable" as a selling point (it's a given, not a headline)
- "Transform" / "Revolutionary" / "Game-changer"
- "Good" / "Quality" / "Premium" / "Best" (prove it or lose it)
- "Better for you" (compared to what?)
- Generic claims that a competitor could also say
- Guilt or fear tactics about other products
- Crude language (no "crap," "bullshit," etc.)
- Anything you can't picture, count, or verify

---

### THE FALSIFIABILITY TEST

Before you write a claim, ask: could a bad product also say this?

| Fails the test        | Passes the test                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "Good stuff"          | "Coconut oil from Sri Lanka"                       |
| "High quality"        | "No parabens, sulfates, or silicones"              |
| "Fair price"          | "Costs less than your morning coffee"              |
| "Long lasting"        | "Still working at midnight"                        |
| "Natural ingredients" | "Five ingredients. You can pronounce all of them." |
| "Effective formula"   | "Clears oil without that tight feeling"            |

If a competitor selling garbage could make the same claim, rewrite it.

### TONE BY CONTEXT

| Context                | Tone                                  | Example                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product description    | Cheeky, sensory, anchored by one fact | "Thick enough you'll feel it. Light enough you'll forget it. Shea butter from Ghana." |
| Social media           | Playful, observational, warm          | "Show us your morning face. The real one."                                            |
| Email marketing        | Friendly, direct, a little flirty     | "We made something. Smells like grapefruit. Sinks in fast. You'll probably want it."  |
| Shipping notifications | Straight to the point                 | "Your order shipped. Arriving Thursday."                                              |
| Ingredient info        | Clear, minimal, factual               | "Coconut oil. Softens skin. From Sri Lanka."                                          |
| Customer complaints    | Warm first, light if appropriate      | "That's not the morning we wanted for you. Let's fix it."                             |
| Serious issues         | Warm, direct, no jokes                | "We hear you. Here's what we're doing about it."                                      |

### THE WAKEY TEST

Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. Would I actually say this to a friend at 7am?
2. Can someone picture what I'm describing?
3. Can I cut any words without losing meaning?
4. Does it sound like a person or a brand?
5. Is it true? Could I prove it?
6. Could a bad product make the same claim?

If any answer is wrong, rewrite.

### ONE LAST THING

Wakey celebrates mornings as they actually are. Messy, slow, rushed, late, early, quiet, chaotic. All of them count.

We're not here to fix your morning. We're here to be the one good thing in it.
